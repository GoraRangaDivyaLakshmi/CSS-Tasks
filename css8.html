    <h1>About NodeJS</h1>
    <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment 
       that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the 
       V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
       Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

       A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
       Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent 
       JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking 
       paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
