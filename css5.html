    <h1 id="unique">About Web Development</h1>
    <p  id="union">Web development is the work involved in developing a website
         for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
         [1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static
          page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses,
           and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which
            Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design,
             Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web
              server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
